function [desired_state] = trajectory_generator(t, qn, varargin)
% TRAJECTORY_GENERATOR: Turn a Dijkstra or A* path into a trajectory
% t: A scalar, specifying inquiry time
%
% varargin: variable number of input arguments. In the framework,
% this function will first (and only once!) be called like this:
%
% trajectory_generator([],[], 0, path)
%
% i.e. map = varargin{1} and path = varargin{2}.
%
% path: A N x 3 matrix where each row is (x, y, z) coordinate of a
% point in the path. N is the total number of points in the path
%
% This is when you compute and store the trajectory.
%
% Later it will be called with only t and qn as an argument, at
% which point you generate the desired state for point t.
%

desired_state = [];

% use the "persistent" keyword to keep your trajectory around
% inbetween function calls
